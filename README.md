# How to deploy AMQ7 on OpenShift using S2I

Configuration of the AMQ7 image can also be modified using the S2I (Source-to-image) feature.

Custom AMQ broker configuration can be specified by creating an broker.xml file inside the git directory of your applicationâ€™s Git project root. On each commit, the file will be copied to the conf directory in the AMQ root and its contents used to configure the broker.

Create first a new project (namespace) called Broker:
```
oc new-project broker
```
Now let's s2i our conf to the jboss-amq image

```
$ oc new-build registry.redhat.io/amq-broker-7/amq-broker-73-openshift:7.3~https://github.com/abouchama/amq7-s2i.git
--> Found Docker image 213daa8 (2 weeks old) from registry.redhat.io for "registry.redhat.io/amq-broker-7/amq-broker-73-openshift:7.3"

    Red Hat AMQ Broker 7.3.0 
    ------------------------ 
    A reliable messaging platform that supports standard messaging paradigms for a real-time enterprise.

    Tags: messaging, amq, java, jboss, xpaas

    * An image stream tag will be created as "amq-broker-73-openshift:7.3" that will track the source image
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/abouchama/amq7-s2i.git will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "amq7-s2i:latest"
      * Every time "amq-broker-73-openshift:7.3" changes a new build will be triggered

--> Creating resources with label build=amq7-s2i ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "amq7-s2i" created
    buildconfig.build.openshift.io "amq7-s2i" created
--> Success
```

To stream the build progress, run 'oc logs -f bc/amq7-s2i', You can see here that our conf broker.xml has been copied to the image stream:

```
$ oc logs -f bc/amq7-s2i

Create the service account "amq-service-account"
```
echo '{"kind": "ServiceAccount", "apiVersion": "v1", "metadata": {"name": "amq-service-account"}}' | oc create -f -
serviceaccount "amq-service-account" created
```

Ensure the service account is added to the namespace for view permissions... (for pod scaling)
```
oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:broker:amq-service-account
```

Install templates in the namespace broker:
```
for template in amq-broker-73-basic.yaml \
amq-broker-73-ssl.yaml \
amq-broker-73-custom.yaml \
amq-broker-73-persistence.yaml \
amq-broker-73-persistence-ssl.yaml \
amq-broker-73-persistence-clustered.yaml \
amq-broker-73-persistence-clustered-ssl.yaml;
 do
 oc replace --force -f \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/jboss-amq-7-broker-openshift-image/73-7.3.0.GA/templates/${template}
 done
```

Let's get now, our image stream URL:

```
$ oc get is
NAME                      DOCKER REPO                                      TAGS         UPDATED
amq-broker-73-openshift   172.30.1.1:5000/broker/amq-broker-73-openshift   7.3,latest   33 minutes ago
amq7-s2i                  172.30.1.1:5000/broker/amq7-s2i                  latest       About a minute ago
```

Specify the image (172.30.1.1:5000/broker/amq7-s2i) in one of the templates installed above in the parameter 'IMAGE':
For instance:

```
oc process amq-broker-73-basic -p APPLICATION_NAME=broker-s2i -p AMQ_NAME=broker-s2i -p AMQ_USER=user -p AMQ_PASSWORD=password -p AMQ_PROTOCOL=openwire,amqp,stomp,mqtt,hornetq -p IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE=broker -p IMAGE=172.30.1.1:5000/broker/amq7-s2i -n broker | oc create -f -
```

Update of broker.xml

You should setup the GitHub webhook URL in order to trigger a new build after each update.

You can also do it manually, like following:
```
$ git commit -am "changing my broker conf"

$ git push -u origin master

$ oc start-build amq7-s2i -n broker
build "amq7-s2i-2" started

$ oc deploy broker-amq --latest -n broker
Started deployment #2
Use 'oc logs -f dc/broker-amq' to track its progress.
```
